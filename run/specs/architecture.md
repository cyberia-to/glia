# Architecture

cyb-llm runtime executes models via three parallel paths. Each path
trades off speed, universality, and maintenance differently. Together
they cover the full spectrum from commodity chat to frontier research
without compromise on correctness.

## Three paths

```
                     import (.model file)
                           │
              ┌────────────┼────────────┐
              ▼            ▼            ▼
         ┌────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌───────┐
         │curated │   │  graph  │   │  nox  │
         │fast    │   │ correct │   │future │
         └───┬────┘   └────┬────┘   └───┬───┘
             └────────┬────┴────────────┘
                      ▼
              backend kernels
            (wgpu / metal / cpu)
```

### 1. Curated path — hand-optimized Rust per family

Hand-written forward() in Rust, dispatched by architecture family.
Reads config + weights from `.model`, calls backend kernels directly.

Speed: 1.5-2× llama.cpp on supported families.
Maintenance: ~10-15 family codepaths covering 95% of HF usage.

Families (v1):
- `LlamaStyle` — Llama 2/3, Mistral, Qwen2/3, Phi, Gemma 1/2, SmolLM, DeepSeek-dense, StarCoder, MiMo, NuExtract
- `MoEStyle` — Mixtral, DeepSeek-V2/V3, Qwen-MoE
- `BertStyle` — BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, ModernBERT, Jina embed
- `T5Style` — T5, BART, M2M
- `WhisperStyle` — Whisper encoder-decoder with cross-attn
- `ViTStyle` — ViT, CLIP, SigLIP, PaliGemma
- `CNNStyle` — YOLO, ResNet, ESRGAN
- `UNetDiffusion` — SD 1.5/XL/3
- `DiTDiffusion` — Flux, Hunyuan, Mochi, Wan (video)
- `TTSStyle` — XTTS, Piper, VITS

### 2. Graph path — universal IR walker

Generic executor. Reads graph from `.model` (IR nodes), walks the DAG,
dispatches each op to a backend kernel. No architecture-specific code.

Speed: 1× llama.cpp (30-50% overhead from dispatch + shape inference).
Maintenance: single executor, grows by adding IR ops when a new dataflow
pattern requires it.

Coverage: anything expressible as a composition of IR ops
(`llm/src/ir/ops.rs` has 50+: Matmul, Conv1d/2d/3d, AdaLN, KvCompress,
FlowStep, PatchEmbed, ...). Research models, new architectures,
uncommon layer compositions all run here.

### 3. Nox path — compiled program section (future)

Each `.model` has a `program` section describing the entire pipeline
(tokenize → forward → sample → decode) in trident. The trident
compiler lowers this to nox VM assembly (18 instructions) specialized
for target hardware. Runtime executes nox.

Speed: approaches curated (compiler knows the architecture, can specialize).
Maintenance: zero — compiler generates codepaths automatically.
Timeline: nox/trident mature sometime after v1.

## Dispatch

Import reads `.model` and chooses path:

```
model_type in known_families?
  yes → curated (fastest)
  no  → check graph section present?
    yes → graph executor
    no  → error: "unrecognized model_type, no graph section; try reimport"
```

Explicit override via CLI: `--path=curated|graph|nox`.

Graph is the safety net. A curated path can fail or be missing;
graph always runs if the IR ops are supported.

## Correctness invariants

These must hold across all paths:

1. **Bit-for-bit determinism per path + backend + dtype.**
   Same input, same path, same backend → identical output.

2. **ε-equivalence across paths.**
   Curated and graph for the same model must produce outputs within
   a tolerance (F32: 1e-5, F16: 1e-3, Q4: 1e-2). Any larger divergence
   is a bug in curated (graph is the reference for correctness).

3. **CPU reference is ground truth.**
   Every IR op has a CPU implementation. That implementation matches
   llama.cpp / HF transformers within ε for standard ops. GPU kernels
   verified against CPU.

4. **No silent corruption.**
   If a path can't run a model, it errors with the specific cause
   ("Op::Scan not implemented in graph executor", "model_type `mamba`
   has no curated codepath").

## Backends

Three backends. Each trades off portability, speed, and determinism.

    └─────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └─────────────┘
```

### wgpu+rs — portable

Default everywhere. wgpu for GPU compute (WGSL), Rust CPU fallback
for anything wgpu can't do. Runs on:

- Linux, Windows, macOS (Vulkan, DX12, Metal translation)
- Android (Vulkan)
- Web (WebGPU in browsers)
- Server-class CPUs without dedicated GPU (via integrated GPU or
  software Vulkan)

Speed: baseline. Typical 1× llama.cpp on mid-range GPU.

Universal — if your device can compute, this runs. CPU part is not
a separate backend; it's the fallback path within wgpu+rs for ops
wgpu doesn't implement.

### honeycrisp — Apple Silicon turbo

Full-stack M-series acceleration. More than just Metal:

- **Metal** — GPU compute via MSL kernels
- **ANE** — Apple Neural Engine via MIL graph compilation,
  for convolutions and attention at extreme efficiency
- **AMX** — Apple Matrix coprocessor CPU instructions for f32/f16
  matmul outside GPU dispatch overhead
- **NEON** — ARM SIMD for element-wise fallback
- **unimem** — IOSurface-pinned memory for zero-copy between
  CPU / GPU / ANE (single memory region, no `copy_buffer`)

Backed by the `aruminium` Rust crate (+ `acpu`, `rane` for ANE).

Speed target: 1.5-3× llama.cpp on M1+ — combining the best compute
unit per op (ANE for conv, GPU for attention, AMX for matmul).

Only available on Apple Silicon. On Intel Macs, falls back to wgpu+rs.

### nox — convergent

Deterministic VM executing trident-compiled bytecode (18 instructions).

Scope: long-term target. Trident describes architecture once,
compiler specializes per hardware → output runs on any nox VM
with bit-exact determinism.

Two properties no other backend provides:

1. **Verifiable**: content-addressed bytecode + deterministic VM =
   proof of exact execution. Critical for cyb's on-chain verification.
2. **Portable to future hardware**: a new accelerator only needs a
   nox VM implementation. All existing models re-run without changes.

Speed: post-compilation, approaches honeycrisp on Apple, wgpu+rs
elsewhere. Early versions will be slower.

Not usable today. Adding trident/nox maturity is a separate project.

### Backend contract

```rust
trait Backend {
    fn name(&self) -> &str;               // "wgpu+rs", "honeycrisp", "nox"
    fn supports(&self, op: &Op) -> bool;  // can this backend execute op?
    fn execute(&self, op: &Op, inputs: &[Tensor]) -> Result<Vec<Tensor>>;
}
```

Every backend must produce outputs within the ε-equivalence tolerances
([correctness invariants](#correctness-invariants)) for ops it claims
to support. A backend that returns `supports: true` and produces wrong
output is a bug in that backend, not a contract violation by the caller.

Missing op is **explicit error**, never silent wrong output. The
dispatcher may try another backend, or fall back to the internal CPU
reference library (which implements every op).

### CPU reference library

Not a user-facing backend. A Rust library implementing every IR op
in pure f32, used for:

- Correctness authority (golden values in tests)
- Fallback inside wgpu+rs when wgpu can't dispatch an op
- Debugging — always available, slow, always correct

Consequence: **any model runs anywhere**, at worst in pure Rust
on CPU. Speed degrades to compute bound, correctness never degrades.

#### Principles

The CPU library is the reference. It is read by humans verifying the
spec and by GPU kernels generating goldens. Five constraints, in
priority order:

1. Correctness — matches the spec, bit-for-bit deterministic.
2. Reliability — no panics, no UB, no silent wrong output.
3. Readability — a reader new to the project understands an op from
   one file. Algorithm before micro-optimization.
4. Compactness — every line earns its keep. Delete before adding.
5. Speed — fast when achievable inside the constraints above.

Speed never trumps the first four. If a fast version costs readability
or compactness, push it down to a specialized backend instead.

#### Portability discipline

CPU code targets every architecture cyb may run on. To keep this real:

- No arch-specific intrinsics (`core::arch::aarch64`, `core::arch::x86_64`).
- No `#[cfg(target_arch = "...")]` paths inside CPU ops.
- No `target_feature` attributes.
- No `target-cpu=native` build assumptions.

Allowed abstractions that stay portable:

- `wide::f32x8` for SIMD (compiler picks NEON / AVX / WASM SIMD).
- `rayon` for thread-level parallelism.
- `std::simd` once stabilized.

If a kernel needs hand-written NEON, AMX, AVX-512, etc., that work
belongs in honeycrisp (Apple Silicon), wgpu+rs kernels (GPU), or nox
(deterministic VM) — never in `cpu/`. The CPU reference is what
proves those backends correct; specialization in the reference defeats
the point.

## Evolution

The three paths are not eternal. They converge:

**Today (v1):**
- Curated handles top 10 families hand-written
- Graph handles everything else, slower
- Nox not yet usable

**Mid-term:**
- Curated stays for hot paths (big LLMs where 2× matters)
- Graph path improved via better op fusion, matches curated on
  medium-size models
- Nox compiles simple program sections, experimental

**Long-term:**
- Nox produces codepaths that match or exceed curated
- Curated shrinks to just the 2-3 flagships that benefit from manual
  tuning
- Graph stays as correctness reference and research fallback

The spec accommodates this evolution: curated and graph are
implementation strategies, not architectural boundaries. The
contract is stable; strategies change.

## What lives where

| Concern | Curated | Graph | Nox |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model architecture | Rust code | IR nodes | trident source |
| Tokenizer | In codepath | In codepath | In program |
| Chat template | In codepath | Config | In program |
| Sampling | In codepath | Config | In program |
| KV cache | Manual | Manual | Compiler |
| Specialization | Hand | Backend kernel | Compiler target |

## Decision log

- 2026-04-17: Hybrid architecture approved — curated for speed,
  graph for universality, nox for the future. Correctness is the
  contract; implementation strategy is flexible.
- 2026-04-17: Graph executor resurrected from "not used" state. It
  is the safety net for everything curated doesn't cover. Must
  work correctly even when slow.
- 2026-04-17: CPU reference is the correctness authority. Every
  op has a CPU implementation; GPU kernels verified against it.
- 2026-04-17: Backend contract: CPU fallback for unsupported ops.
  Any graph runs on any backend, at worst slowly.
- 2026-04-17: Three backends: wgpu+rs (portable default), honeycrisp
  (Apple Silicon turbo — Metal+ANE+AMX+NEON+unimem via aruminium),
  nox (convergent VM, future). CPU is a reference library not a
  backend. CUDA+TensorCore turbo is future, analogous to honeycrisp.
